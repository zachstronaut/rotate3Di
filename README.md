Rotate3Di is a jQuery Effect Plugin that makes it possible to do an isometric 3D flip or 3D rotation of any HTML content. It also enables custom 3D rotation animations. CSS3 Transforms are used to create this visual "3D" isometric effect. Supported browsers are Safari/Chrome/Webkit, Firefox 3.5+, IE 9+, and Opera 11+. The plugin's functionality includes: setting or animating HTML content to an arbitrary isometric rotation angle, as well as flipping, unflipping, or toggling the flip state of an object.  Currently tested with jQuery 1.3.x through 1.6.
