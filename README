rotate3Di

Rotate3Di is a jQuery Effect Plugin that makes it possible to do an isometric
3D flip or 3D rotation of any HTML content. It also enables custom 3D rotation
animations. CSS3 Transforms are used to create this visual "3D" isometric
effect. Supported browsers are WebKit, Safari, Chrome, Firefox 3.5+,
IE9 (Platform Preview 7+), and probably Opera. The plugin's functionality
includes: setting or animating HTML content to an arbitrary isometric rotation
angle, as well as flipping, unflipping, or toggling the flip state of an object.

This code is currently available for use in all personal or commercial projects
under both MIT and GPL licenses, just like jQuery.
